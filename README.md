BigPanda OIM (Open Integration Manager) configuration examples


In the folders included, please locate overview guides and configuration example images and exports from BigPanda's Open Integration Manager. 

As time allows, if there isn't already a standard template or guides provided by BigPanda on the https://docs.bigpanda.io - I will add some here.

As always, I imply no warranty and advise you to use these guides as a reference but to use your best judgement when applying these types of configurations.  

:brain Enjoy!
